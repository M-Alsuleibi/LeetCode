## **6 Steps to Ace the Coding Interview**

These steps are not a specific industry standard that everybody agreed to follow. However, it’s generally understood that this is the high-level approach to succeed.

1. **Ask Clarifying Questions**
    - Aim to spend 1-5 minutes on this part, depending on how complex the question is.
    - Validate that you understand the question correctly by stating or agreeing on your assumptions and constraints.
        - Example: Ask about the input, and whether you need to write the full class or just a function.
    - Examples: Can I assume that I have a list of all words as an input?

2. **Come Up with a Medium-Sized Example Input**
    - Unless the interviewer gives this to you, come up with your own example.
        - If the interviewer gives you a simple example, you should still come up with a medium-sized one.
    - It should not be too small nor too big (you will use this to step through your code later).
    - This is another way to confirm with the interviewer that you understand the question.

3. **Propose a Simple Solution, Then Iterate Until Optimal Solution is Found**
    - Mention the brute force solution that first comes to mind.
    - Identify the problem with the brute force solution (e.g., Big O complexity).
    - Think about better solutions and mention them to your interviewer as you come up with them.
    - Once you come up with the best solution you can, ask the interviewer if the proposed approach is reasonable.
    - Write pseudocode.

4. **Start Coding**
    - You don't need to talk while coding unless something is complicated that the interviewer won’t understand.
    - Remember to use proper indentation, good variable names, and write clean code.
    - If some code is complex, put a placeholder for a helper method and implement it later.
    - Once done with the main method, implement the helper methods.
        - Don't move on to the next step until this is done.

5. **After Writing the Code, Walk Through It with the Example from Step 2**
    - After you finish coding, don’t say “I think this should work” until you walk through it with the example you initially came up with.
    - Walk through the code line by line, very carefully.
    - Write in-line comments with the values of the variables.
    - Ensure that the output your code produces matches the expected output.
    - If it doesn’t produce the correct output, remain calm and debug it until it does.

6. **Once Code Seems to Work, Claim It's Done and Offer to List Out Test Cases**
    - "I think this code should work, but if this were meant to be production code, I would unit test it with a few different test cases that I can go over if you'd like me to."
    - Consider test cases like null input, empty input, size 1, large input, all same elements in input, all different elements in input, etc.
