##Approach:
Breadth  First Search Algorithm: Time complexity:`O(n)`,Space Complexity: `O(n)`.Where n number of nodes. 
## Note:

- `pop()`:- This function is used to delete an argument from the right end of the deque. 
- `popleft()`:- This function is used to delete an argument from the left end of the deque.
