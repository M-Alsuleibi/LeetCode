# [94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/description/) `EASY`
## Two Approaches Solution:
- Iterative Approach _MEDIUM_
- Recursive Approach _EASY_
## Time complexity and Space complexity:
 
- Time complexity of Inorder traversal is O(n), where 'n' is the size of binary tree.
- Space complexity of inorder traversal is O(1),
 if we do not consider the stack size for function calls.
 Otherwise, the space complexity of inorder traversal is O(h), where 'h' is the height of tree
